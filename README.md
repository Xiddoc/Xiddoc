# Hey, I'm Xiddoc ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¥³

Although my favorite langauges are Python and Java, I love learning and using all sorts of different technologies and languages, for all sorts of purposes!

Alongside developing useful programs to solve my and other people's problems, I also like playing CTFs and helping strengthen cybersecurity by participating in VDPs and Bug Bounties.
